# Branch Note

**Branch Note** is a powerful VS Code extension designed to help developers keep track of branch-specific notes and to-dos. Never lose context when switching branches again!

## Why Branch Note?

### 1. Seamless Team Collaboration
Share knowledge effortlessy with your team. By leaving notes on a branch, any team member checking out that branch will see the relevant context, instructions, or pending tasks.
> **Note:** To enable team sharing, make sure to commit the `.branch-notes.json` file to your repository.
